## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. WhatsApp:

End-to-End Encryption: WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption for messages, ensuring privacy and security.
Media Sharing: Users can easily share various types of media, including photos, videos, and documents, enhancing communication.

2. Spotify:

Personalized Recommendations: Spotify uses algorithms to provide personalized music recommendations based on user preferences.
Offline Listening: Users can download music for offline listening, allowing them to enjoy their favorite tracks without an internet connection.

3. Evernote:

Note Organization: Evernote excels in organizing notes, allowing users to categorize and tag their information efficiently.
Cross-Platform Syncing: Evernote seamlessly syncs notes across various devices, enabling users to access their information from anywhere.


App Idea I like to build: Introducing "GreenThumb," an app that guides users in cultivating indoor gardens. Features include a virtual garden planner, personalized care reminders, a social platform for sharing tips, and a plant identification tool. GreenThumb aims to make indoor gardening accessible, educational, and community-driven.
## Notes

At first I had some problems finding storyboard and dragging the button to inside the view controller class.
